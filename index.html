            <h2>Adoption</h2>
            <p>Pet adoption is the process of transferring responsibility for a pet. Common sources for adoptable pets are animal shelters, rescue groups, or other pet owners. Some organizations give adopters ownership of the pet, while others use a guardianship model wherein the organization retains some control over the animal's future use or care.</p>

            <h2>Before adoption</h2>
            <p>Animals are placed up for adoption for numerous reasons like being abandoned, lost, or rehomed from their current family. The need for rehoming sometimes results from allergies, death of a pet-owner, divorce, the birth of a baby, or relocation. Additionally, adoption mayweather, and traffic and enter adoption shelters in need of medical attention before entering the adoption process. After medical examinations, treatments, and behavioral tests, adoption centers (at their discretion) determine if the pet is healthy enough for adoption.</p>

            <h2>Adoption process</h2>
            <p>The central issue in adoption is whether the new adopter can provide a safe, secure, and permanent home for the adopted pet. Shelters, pounds, and rescue organizations can refuse to supply pets to people whom they deem unable to provide a suitable home. A new owner may face training or behavioral challenges with a pet who has been neglected, abused, or left untrained. Adoption centers recommend patience, training, persistence, and consistency of care to help the pet overcome its past and get comfortable with the adopter.</p>
